1. Reviewing the lecture content before doing homework could help a lot. When I was solving
   problems, I had to refer to the slides from time to time because I could not remember everything
   without any practice.
2. I think during class we could have more examples discussed. Some examples on slides are very
   simple but lack depth.
3. More Dafny tutorials would be quite useful, such as arrays and forall statement.
