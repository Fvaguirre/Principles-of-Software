2.1
True subtype: 
Isosceles has the same function in triangle. The effect of the constructor in isosceles is stronger
than the regular triangle because it ensures two sides are also equal so it has a stronger spec.
It can replace regular triangle anywhere.

2.2
Not true subtype(Squid):
If it was substituted for a vertebrate object, it could work incorrectly since it does not have a
stronger spec than vertebrate. 
True subtype(Human):
It has a stronger spec.

2.3
Not true subtype:
Anywhere the bike class constructor is called is not replaceable with the mountain bike class
constructor because that constructor expects one more argument.

2.4
Not true subtype:
A concurrent account can be used to replace a regular account and it could throw an exception when
the user does not expect it. Concurrent cannot replace account everywhere
